### Docker-Compose
Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services.
Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

Check the version:
```sh
docker-compose --version
```

Start the application:
```sh
docker-compose up
```
